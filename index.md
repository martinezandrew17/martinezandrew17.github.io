### CPSC 120

    . Lab 5
      Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorites because we were able to find the area of a rectangle through a computer. Though simple, it was satisfying to complete. The idea was also different from what we were learning at the time.

    . Lab 1
      Lab 1 was one of my favorites because it started the programming journey. It was a simple Hello World! program with just an introduction of our names. It also sparked my interest in continuing my major. 

    . Lab 4
      Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites because of the simple guessing game. It was also one of the first labs that introduced the ideas of loops and how they work. Loops are now part of our weekly labs.
